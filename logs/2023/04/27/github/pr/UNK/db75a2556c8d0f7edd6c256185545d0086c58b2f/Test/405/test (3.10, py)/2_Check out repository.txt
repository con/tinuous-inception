2023-04-27T15:24:22.8002284Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2023-04-27T15:24:22.8002749Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2023-04-27T15:24:22.8003705Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2023-04-27T15:24:22.8004039Z 
2023-04-27T15:24:22.8004270Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2023-04-27T15:24:22.8005175Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2023-04-27T15:24:22.8005488Z 
2023-04-27T15:24:22.8006190Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2023-04-27T15:24:22.8006476Z 
2023-04-27T15:24:22.8006648Z Or undo this operation with:
2023-04-27T15:24:22.8006865Z 
2023-04-27T15:24:22.8007013Z   git switch -

2023-04-27T15:24:22.8008131Z Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
