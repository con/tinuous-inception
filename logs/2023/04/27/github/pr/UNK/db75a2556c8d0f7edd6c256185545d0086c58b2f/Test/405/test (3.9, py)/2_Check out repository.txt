2023-04-27T15:24:22.1424772Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2023-04-27T15:24:22.1425879Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2023-04-27T15:24:22.1426955Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2023-04-27T15:24:22.1427467Z 
2023-04-27T15:24:22.1428117Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2023-04-27T15:24:22.1428877Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2023-04-27T15:24:22.1429578Z 
2023-04-27T15:24:22.1430010Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2023-04-27T15:24:22.1430668Z 
2023-04-27T15:24:22.1431007Z Or undo this operation with:
2023-04-27T15:24:22.1433438Z 
2023-04-27T15:24:22.1433894Z   git switch -
2023-04-27T15:24:22.1434558Z 
2023-04-27T15:24:22.1434982Z Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
