2021-07-09T14:29:28.2637487Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-07-09T14:29:28.2638439Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-07-09T14:29:28.2639406Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-07-09T14:29:28.2639997Z 
2021-07-09T14:29:28.2640693Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-07-09T14:29:28.2641798Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-07-09T14:29:28.2643167Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-07-09T14:29:28.2643681Z 
2021-07-09T14:29:28.2644327Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-07-09T14:29:28.2644796Z 
2021-07-09T14:29:28.2645466Z   git switch -
