2021-06-11T15:49:40.7697564Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-11T15:49:40.7698597Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-11T15:49:40.7699723Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-11T15:49:40.7700304Z 
2021-06-11T15:49:40.7701028Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-11T15:49:40.7702188Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-06-11T15:49:40.7702766Z 
2021-06-11T15:49:40.7703637Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-11T15:49:40.7704166Z 
2021-06-11T15:49:40.7704751Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-11T15:49:40.7705207Z
