2021-06-04T15:27:52.3047615Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-04T15:27:52.3048552Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-04T15:27:52.3049095Z

2021-06-04T15:27:52.3052460Z 
2021-06-04T15:27:52.3052969Z Or undo this operation with:
