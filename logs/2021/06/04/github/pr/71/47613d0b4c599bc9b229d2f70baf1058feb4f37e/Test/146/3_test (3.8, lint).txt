2021-06-04T15:27:49.3693868Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-04T15:27:49.3694849Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-04T15:27:49.3695841Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-04T15:27:49.3696378Z 
2021-06-04T15:27:49.3697291Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-04T15:27:49.3698416Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-06-04T15:27:49.3699765Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-04T15:27:49.3700267Z 
2021-06-04T15:27:49.3700913Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-04T15:27:49.3701328Z
