2021-06-04T15:27:52.1977952Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-04T15:27:52.1978839Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-04T15:27:52.1979722Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-04T15:27:52.1980230Z 
2021-06-04T15:27:52.1980801Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-04T15:27:52.1981835Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-06-04T15:27:52.1982310Z 
2021-06-04T15:27:52.1982937Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-04T15:27:52.1983334Z 
2021-06-04T15:27:52.1983758Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-04T15:27:52.1984109Z
