2021-06-10T15:28:40.3003898Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T15:28:40.3004860Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T15:28:40.3005857Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T15:28:40.3006416Z

2021-06-10T15:28:40.3010445Z 
2021-06-10T15:28:40.3011360Z Or undo this operation with:
