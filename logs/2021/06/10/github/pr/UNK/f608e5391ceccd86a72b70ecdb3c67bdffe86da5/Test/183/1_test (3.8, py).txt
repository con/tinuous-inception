2021-06-10T15:28:39.5604360Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T15:28:39.5605140Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T15:28:39.5605968Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T15:28:39.5606394Z 
2021-06-10T15:28:39.5606960Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-10T15:28:39.5607784Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-06-10T15:28:39.5609318Z 
2021-06-10T15:28:39.5609831Z Or undo this operation with:
