2021-06-10T15:28:39.9603466Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T15:28:39.9604433Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T15:28:39.9605273Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T15:28:39.9605818Z

2021-06-10T15:28:39.9609221Z 
2021-06-10T15:28:39.9609653Z Or undo this operation with:
