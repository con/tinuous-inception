2021-06-10T14:15:28.6276354Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T14:15:28.6277542Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T14:15:28.6278739Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T14:15:28.6279367Z 
2021-06-10T14:15:28.6280231Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-10T14:15:28.6281609Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-06-10T14:15:28.6282272Z 
2021-06-10T14:15:28.6283154Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-10T14:15:28.6283768Z 
2021-06-10T14:15:28.6284504Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T14:15:28.6284988Z 
2021-06-10T14:15:28.6285858Z   git switch -
