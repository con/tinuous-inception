2021-06-10T14:15:29.4880005Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T14:15:29.4881305Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T14:15:29.4882424Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T14:15:29.4883113Z 
2021-06-10T14:15:29.4883977Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-10T14:15:29.4885241Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-06-10T14:15:29.4886913Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-10T14:15:29.4887525Z 
2021-06-10T14:15:29.4888192Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T14:15:29.4888736Z 
2021-06-10T14:15:29.4889579Z   git switch -
