2021-06-10T14:15:30.4263746Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T14:15:30.4264887Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T14:15:30.4265945Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T14:15:30.4266617Z 
2021-06-10T14:15:30.4267660Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-10T14:15:30.4269932Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-06-10T14:15:30.4271785Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-10T14:15:30.4272384Z 
2021-06-10T14:15:30.4273050Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T14:15:30.4273569Z 
2021-06-10T14:15:30.4274884Z   git switch -
