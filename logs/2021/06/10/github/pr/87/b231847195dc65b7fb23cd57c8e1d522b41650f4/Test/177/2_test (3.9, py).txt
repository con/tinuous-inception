2021-06-10T14:15:29.0928989Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T14:15:29.0930176Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T14:15:29.0931262Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T14:15:29.0931952Z

2021-06-10T14:15:29.0934092Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-06-10T14:15:29.0936437Z 
2021-06-10T14:15:29.0937124Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T14:15:29.0937674Z
