2021-06-10T18:30:45.2888429Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T18:30:45.2889320Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T18:30:45.2890143Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T18:30:45.2890674Z

2021-06-10T18:30:45.2892290Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-06-10T18:30:45.2893801Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-10T18:30:45.2894316Z 
2021-06-10T18:30:45.2894852Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T18:30:45.2895295Z
