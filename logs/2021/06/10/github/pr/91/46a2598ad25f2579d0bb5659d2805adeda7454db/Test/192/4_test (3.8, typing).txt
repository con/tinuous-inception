2021-06-10T18:30:45.3856837Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T18:30:45.3857705Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T18:30:45.3858602Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T18:30:45.3859026Z 
2021-06-10T18:30:45.3859714Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-10T18:30:45.3860652Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-06-10T18:30:45.3861800Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-10T18:30:45.3862189Z 
2021-06-10T18:30:45.3862651Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T18:30:45.3863004Z 
2021-06-10T18:30:45.3863527Z   git switch -
