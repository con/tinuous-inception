2021-06-10T18:30:46.1702407Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T18:30:46.1704009Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T18:30:46.1705160Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T18:30:46.1706208Z 
2021-06-10T18:30:46.1707078Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may

2021-06-10T18:30:46.1710851Z 
2021-06-10T18:30:46.1711544Z Or undo this operation with:
