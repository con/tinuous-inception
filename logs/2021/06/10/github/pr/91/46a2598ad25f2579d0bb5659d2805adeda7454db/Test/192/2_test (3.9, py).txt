2021-06-10T18:30:45.6695206Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T18:30:45.6696383Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T18:30:45.6697353Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T18:30:45.6697998Z 
2021-06-10T18:30:45.6698759Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-10T18:30:45.6699899Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-06-10T18:30:45.6700517Z 
2021-06-10T18:30:45.6701384Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-10T18:30:45.6701943Z 
2021-06-10T18:30:45.6702439Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T18:30:45.6702816Z 
2021-06-10T18:30:45.6703423Z   git switch -
