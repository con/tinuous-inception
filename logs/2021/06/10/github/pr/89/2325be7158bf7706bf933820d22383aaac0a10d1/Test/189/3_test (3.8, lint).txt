2021-06-10T17:02:27.2852973Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T17:02:27.2853853Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

2021-06-10T17:02:27.2858283Z 
2021-06-10T17:02:27.2859106Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T17:02:27.2859578Z
