2021-06-10T17:02:26.1816389Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T17:02:26.1817410Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T17:02:26.1818320Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T17:02:26.1818900Z 
2021-06-10T17:02:26.1819520Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-10T17:02:26.1820656Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-06-10T17:02:26.1821901Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-10T17:02:26.1822376Z 
2021-06-10T17:02:26.1822906Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T17:02:26.1823328Z
