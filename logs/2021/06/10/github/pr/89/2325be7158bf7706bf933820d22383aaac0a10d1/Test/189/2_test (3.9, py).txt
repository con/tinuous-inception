2021-06-10T17:02:25.8847101Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T17:02:25.8848211Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T17:02:25.8849409Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T17:02:25.8850097Z 
2021-06-10T17:02:25.8851020Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-10T17:02:25.8852317Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-06-10T17:02:25.8854315Z 
2021-06-10T17:02:25.8854967Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T17:02:25.8855402Z
