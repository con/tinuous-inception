2021-06-10T15:34:26.0800246Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T15:34:26.0801115Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T15:34:26.0801905Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T15:34:26.0802383Z 
2021-06-10T15:34:26.0803165Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-10T15:34:26.0804293Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-06-10T15:34:26.0805610Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-10T15:34:26.0806102Z 
2021-06-10T15:34:26.0806665Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T15:34:26.0807122Z
