2021-06-10T15:34:27.7435147Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T15:34:27.7435962Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T15:34:27.7436739Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

2021-06-10T15:34:27.7440134Z 
2021-06-10T15:34:27.7440527Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T15:34:27.7440845Z
