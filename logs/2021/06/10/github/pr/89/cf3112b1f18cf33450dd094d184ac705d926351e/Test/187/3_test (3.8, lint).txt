2021-06-10T15:34:26.7122586Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T15:34:26.7123418Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

2021-06-10T15:34:26.7126849Z 
2021-06-10T15:34:26.7127273Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T15:34:26.7127550Z
