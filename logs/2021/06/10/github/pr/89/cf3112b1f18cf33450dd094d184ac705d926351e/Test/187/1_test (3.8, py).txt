2021-06-10T15:34:26.4788570Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T15:34:26.4789648Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T15:34:26.4790892Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T15:34:26.4791585Z 
2021-06-10T15:34:26.4792388Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may

2021-06-10T15:34:26.4795918Z 
2021-06-10T15:34:26.4796647Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T15:34:26.4797195Z
