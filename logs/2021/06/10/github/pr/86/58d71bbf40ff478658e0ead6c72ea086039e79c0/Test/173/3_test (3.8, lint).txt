2021-06-10T14:03:53.0604657Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T14:03:53.0605599Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T14:03:53.0606633Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T14:03:53.0607321Z 
2021-06-10T14:03:53.0607826Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-10T14:03:53.0608784Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-06-10T14:03:53.0609293Z 
2021-06-10T14:03:53.0609876Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-10T14:03:53.0610321Z 
2021-06-10T14:03:53.0610724Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T14:03:53.0611119Z 
2021-06-10T14:03:53.0611599Z   git switch -
