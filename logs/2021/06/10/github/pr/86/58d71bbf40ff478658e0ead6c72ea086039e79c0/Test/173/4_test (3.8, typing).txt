2021-06-10T14:03:53.8320733Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T14:03:53.8321382Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T14:03:53.8322004Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T14:03:53.8322356Z 
2021-06-10T14:03:53.8322786Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-10T14:03:53.8323530Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-06-10T14:03:53.8323856Z 
2021-06-10T14:03:53.8324324Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-10T14:03:53.8324611Z 
2021-06-10T14:03:53.8324919Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T14:03:53.8325175Z 
2021-06-10T14:03:53.8325565Z   git switch -
