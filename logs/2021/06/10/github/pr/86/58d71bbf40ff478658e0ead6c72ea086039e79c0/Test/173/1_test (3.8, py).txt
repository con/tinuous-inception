2021-06-10T14:03:52.0936733Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T14:03:52.0937803Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T14:03:52.0938789Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T14:03:52.0939446Z 
2021-06-10T14:03:52.0940341Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-10T14:03:52.0941499Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-06-10T14:03:52.0942175Z 
2021-06-10T14:03:52.0943023Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-10T14:03:52.0943638Z 
2021-06-10T14:03:52.0944288Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T14:03:52.0945185Z 
2021-06-10T14:03:52.0946173Z   git switch -
