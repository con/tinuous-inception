2021-06-10T15:04:16.7830427Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T15:04:16.7831263Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T15:04:16.7832110Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T15:04:16.7832659Z 
2021-06-10T15:04:16.7833298Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-10T15:04:16.7834292Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-06-10T15:04:16.7835950Z 
2021-06-10T15:04:16.7836552Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T15:04:16.7836969Z
