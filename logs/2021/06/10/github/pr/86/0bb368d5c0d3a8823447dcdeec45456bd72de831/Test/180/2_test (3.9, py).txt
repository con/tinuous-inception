2021-06-10T15:04:16.6530784Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T15:04:16.6531742Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T15:04:16.6532619Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T15:04:16.6533199Z 
2021-06-10T15:04:16.6533956Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-10T15:04:16.6535044Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-06-10T15:04:16.6535547Z 
2021-06-10T15:04:16.6536344Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-10T15:04:16.6536845Z 
2021-06-10T15:04:16.6537414Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T15:04:16.6537872Z
