2021-06-10T15:04:17.8483598Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T15:04:17.8484533Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T15:04:17.8485493Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T15:04:17.8486106Z 
2021-06-10T15:04:17.8486847Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-10T15:04:17.8487892Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-06-10T15:04:17.8489315Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-10T15:04:17.8489816Z 
2021-06-10T15:04:17.8490421Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T15:04:17.8490887Z 
2021-06-10T15:04:17.8491598Z   git switch -
