2021-06-10T15:04:18.3588278Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T15:04:18.3589217Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T15:04:18.3590060Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T15:04:18.3590614Z 
2021-06-10T15:04:18.3591408Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-10T15:04:18.3592521Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-06-10T15:04:18.3593120Z 
2021-06-10T15:04:18.3593938Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-10T15:04:18.3594459Z 
2021-06-10T15:04:18.3595040Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T15:04:18.3595528Z 
2021-06-10T15:04:18.3596218Z   git switch -
