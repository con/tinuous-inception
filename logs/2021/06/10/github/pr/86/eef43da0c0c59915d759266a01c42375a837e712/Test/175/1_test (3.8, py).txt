2021-06-10T14:08:18.3406646Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T14:08:18.3407569Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T14:08:18.3408440Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T14:08:18.3408992Z 
2021-06-10T14:08:18.3409677Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-10T14:08:18.3410673Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-06-10T14:08:18.3411226Z 
2021-06-10T14:08:18.3411951Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-10T14:08:18.3412438Z 
2021-06-10T14:08:18.3412946Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T14:08:18.3413377Z 
2021-06-10T14:08:18.3413920Z   git switch -
