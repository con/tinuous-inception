2021-06-10T14:08:19.4268342Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T14:08:19.4269233Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T14:08:19.4270076Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T14:08:19.4270574Z 
2021-06-10T14:08:19.4271206Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-10T14:08:19.4272256Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-06-10T14:08:19.4272733Z 
2021-06-10T14:08:19.4273445Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-10T14:08:19.4273835Z 
2021-06-10T14:08:19.4274517Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T14:08:19.4274896Z 
2021-06-10T14:08:19.4275521Z   git switch -
