2021-06-10T14:08:17.0887061Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T14:08:17.0888012Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T14:08:17.0889022Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T14:08:17.0889611Z 
2021-06-10T14:08:17.0890400Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-10T14:08:17.0891463Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-06-10T14:08:17.0892039Z 
2021-06-10T14:08:17.0892892Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-10T14:08:17.0893416Z 
2021-06-10T14:08:17.0894032Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T14:08:17.0894508Z 
2021-06-10T14:08:17.0895230Z   git switch -
