2021-06-10T14:08:16.2104711Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-10T14:08:16.2105754Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-10T14:08:16.2106694Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-10T14:08:16.2107372Z 
2021-06-10T14:08:16.2108168Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-10T14:08:16.2109271Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-06-10T14:08:16.2109872Z 
2021-06-10T14:08:16.2110771Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-10T14:08:16.2111333Z 
2021-06-10T14:08:16.2111967Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-10T14:08:16.2112459Z 
2021-06-10T14:08:16.2113223Z   git switch -
