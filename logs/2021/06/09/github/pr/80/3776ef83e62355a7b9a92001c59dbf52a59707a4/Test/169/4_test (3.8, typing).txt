2021-06-09T12:54:56.0625918Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-09T12:54:56.0627216Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-09T12:54:56.0628416Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-09T12:54:56.0628971Z 
2021-06-09T12:54:56.0629566Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-09T12:54:56.0630577Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-06-09T12:54:56.0631121Z 
2021-06-09T12:54:56.0631831Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-09T12:54:56.0632311Z 
2021-06-09T12:54:56.0632773Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-09T12:54:56.0633165Z 
2021-06-09T12:54:56.0634404Z   git switch -
