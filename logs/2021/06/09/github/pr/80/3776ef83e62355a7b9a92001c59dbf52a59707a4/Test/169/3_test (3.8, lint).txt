2021-06-09T12:54:57.3173566Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-06-09T12:54:57.3174682Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-06-09T12:54:57.3175684Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-06-09T12:54:57.3176333Z 
2021-06-09T12:54:57.3177044Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-06-09T12:54:57.3178411Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-06-09T12:54:57.3179074Z 
2021-06-09T12:54:57.3179921Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-06-09T12:54:57.3180470Z 
2021-06-09T12:54:57.3181203Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-06-09T12:54:57.3181674Z 
2021-06-09T12:54:57.3182346Z   git switch -
