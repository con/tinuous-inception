2021-05-28T15:10:34.4414795Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-28T15:10:34.4415710Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-28T15:10:34.4416563Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

2021-05-28T15:10:34.4417800Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-05-28T15:10:34.4419177Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-05-28T15:10:34.4419563Z 
2021-05-28T15:10:34.4420175Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-05-28T15:10:34.4420563Z 
2021-05-28T15:10:34.4420950Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-28T15:10:34.4421302Z 
2021-05-28T15:10:34.4421818Z   git switch -
