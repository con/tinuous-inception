2021-05-28T15:10:34.4688616Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-28T15:10:34.4689791Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-28T15:10:34.4690945Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

2021-05-28T15:10:34.4692520Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-05-28T15:10:34.4693837Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-05-28T15:10:34.4694514Z 
2021-05-28T15:10:34.4695424Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-05-28T15:10:34.4696036Z 
2021-05-28T15:10:34.4696798Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-28T15:10:34.4697288Z 
2021-05-28T15:10:34.4698130Z   git switch -
