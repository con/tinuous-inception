2021-05-14T15:06:06.4276050Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-14T15:06:06.4277258Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-14T15:06:06.4278416Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-05-14T15:06:06.4279383Z 
2021-05-14T15:06:06.4281309Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-05-14T15:06:06.4282691Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-05-14T15:06:06.4283182Z 
2021-05-14T15:06:06.4283818Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-05-14T15:06:06.4284298Z 
2021-05-14T15:06:06.4284799Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-14T15:06:06.4285107Z 
2021-05-14T15:06:06.4285699Z   git switch -
