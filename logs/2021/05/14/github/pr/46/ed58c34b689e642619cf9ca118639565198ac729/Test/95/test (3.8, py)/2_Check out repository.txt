2021-05-14T15:06:05.4292300Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-14T15:06:05.4293162Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-14T15:06:05.4293969Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

2021-05-14T15:06:05.4295218Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-05-14T15:06:05.4296250Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-05-14T15:06:05.4296791Z 
2021-05-14T15:06:05.4297493Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-05-14T15:06:05.4297962Z 
2021-05-14T15:06:05.4298462Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-14T15:06:05.4298848Z 
2021-05-14T15:06:05.4299448Z   git switch -
