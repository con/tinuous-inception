2021-05-14T15:06:06.0277315Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-14T15:06:06.0277995Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-14T15:06:06.0278640Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-05-14T15:06:06.0279021Z 
2021-05-14T15:06:06.0279463Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-05-14T15:06:06.0280244Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-05-14T15:06:06.0281132Z 
2021-05-14T15:06:06.0282011Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-05-14T15:06:06.0282523Z 
2021-05-14T15:06:06.0282903Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-14T15:06:06.0283202Z 
2021-05-14T15:06:06.0283650Z   git switch -
