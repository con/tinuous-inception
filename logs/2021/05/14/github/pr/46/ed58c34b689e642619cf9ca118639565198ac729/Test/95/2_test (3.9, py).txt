2021-05-14T15:06:07.0443393Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-14T15:06:07.0445004Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-14T15:06:07.0448912Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-05-14T15:06:07.0449689Z 
2021-05-14T15:06:07.0451128Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-05-14T15:06:07.0452663Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-05-14T15:06:07.0453351Z 
2021-05-14T15:06:07.0454431Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-05-14T15:06:07.0454947Z 
2021-05-14T15:06:07.0455448Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-14T15:06:07.0455863Z
