2021-05-14T14:59:52.2812760Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-14T14:59:52.2813439Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-14T14:59:52.2814093Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-05-14T14:59:52.2814460Z

2021-05-14T14:59:52.2817123Z 
2021-05-14T14:59:52.2817446Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-14T14:59:52.2817920Z
