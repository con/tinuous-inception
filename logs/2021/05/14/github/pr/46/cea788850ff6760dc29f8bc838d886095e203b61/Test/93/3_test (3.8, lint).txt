2021-05-14T14:59:54.4592568Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-14T14:59:54.4593474Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-14T14:59:54.4594417Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-05-14T14:59:54.4594959Z

2021-05-14T14:59:54.4596620Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-05-14T14:59:54.4597781Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-05-14T14:59:54.4598204Z 
2021-05-14T14:59:54.4598660Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-14T14:59:54.4599049Z 
2021-05-14T14:59:54.4599626Z   git switch -
