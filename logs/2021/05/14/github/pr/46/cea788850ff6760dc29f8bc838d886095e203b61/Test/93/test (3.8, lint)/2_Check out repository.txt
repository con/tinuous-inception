2021-05-14T14:59:54.4592559Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-14T14:59:54.4593468Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-14T14:59:54.4594406Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

2021-05-14T14:59:54.4595546Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-05-14T14:59:54.4596612Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-05-14T14:59:54.4597056Z 
2021-05-14T14:59:54.4597773Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-05-14T14:59:54.4598199Z 
2021-05-14T14:59:54.4598654Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-14T14:59:54.4599044Z 
2021-05-14T14:59:54.4599619Z   git switch -
