2021-05-14T18:23:01.2406491Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-14T18:23:01.2407392Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-14T18:23:01.2408189Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-05-14T18:23:01.2409243Z 
2021-05-14T18:23:01.2410148Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may

2021-05-14T18:23:01.2412542Z 
2021-05-14T18:23:01.2412917Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-14T18:23:01.2413197Z 
2021-05-14T18:23:01.2413638Z   git switch -
