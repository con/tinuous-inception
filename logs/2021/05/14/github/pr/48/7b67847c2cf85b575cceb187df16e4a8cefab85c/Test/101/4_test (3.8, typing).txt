2021-05-14T18:22:59.3630257Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-14T18:22:59.3632186Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-14T18:22:59.3633090Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-05-14T18:22:59.3633770Z

2021-05-14T18:22:59.3637669Z 
2021-05-14T18:22:59.3638183Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-14T18:22:59.3638752Z 
2021-05-14T18:22:59.3639885Z   git switch -
