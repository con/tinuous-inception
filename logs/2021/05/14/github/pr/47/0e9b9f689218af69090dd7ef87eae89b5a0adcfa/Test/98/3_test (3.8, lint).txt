2021-05-14T15:29:16.2490331Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-14T15:29:16.2491201Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-14T15:29:16.2492092Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-05-14T15:29:16.2492645Z 
2021-05-14T15:29:16.2493369Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-05-14T15:29:16.2494370Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-05-14T15:29:16.2495634Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-05-14T15:29:16.2496056Z 
2021-05-14T15:29:16.2496631Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-14T15:29:16.2497084Z 
2021-05-14T15:29:16.2497725Z   git switch -
