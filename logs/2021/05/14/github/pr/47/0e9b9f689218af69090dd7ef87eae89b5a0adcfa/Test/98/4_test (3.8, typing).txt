2021-05-14T15:29:17.6805747Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-14T15:29:17.6806569Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-14T15:29:17.6807342Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-05-14T15:29:17.6807837Z 
2021-05-14T15:29:17.6808364Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-05-14T15:29:17.6809221Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-05-14T15:29:17.6810085Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-05-14T15:29:17.6810394Z 
2021-05-14T15:29:17.6810730Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-14T15:29:17.6811138Z 
2021-05-14T15:29:17.6811727Z   git switch -
