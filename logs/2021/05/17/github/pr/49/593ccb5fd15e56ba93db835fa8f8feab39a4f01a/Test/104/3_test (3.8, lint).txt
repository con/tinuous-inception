2021-05-17T19:13:29.2656913Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-17T19:13:29.2657945Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-17T19:13:29.2658944Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-05-17T19:13:29.2659487Z 
2021-05-17T19:13:29.2660324Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-05-17T19:13:29.2661490Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-05-17T19:13:29.2662079Z 
2021-05-17T19:13:29.2662870Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-05-17T19:13:29.2663389Z 
2021-05-17T19:13:29.2664136Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-17T19:13:29.2664569Z 
2021-05-17T19:13:29.2665311Z   git switch -
