2021-05-17T19:13:31.0804052Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-17T19:13:31.0804919Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-17T19:13:31.0805762Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-05-17T19:13:31.0806246Z 
2021-05-17T19:13:31.0806810Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-05-17T19:13:31.0807832Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-05-17T19:13:31.0808970Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-05-17T19:13:31.0809337Z 
2021-05-17T19:13:31.0809765Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-17T19:13:31.0810105Z
