2021-05-27T16:36:03.6100740Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-27T16:36:03.6101922Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-27T16:36:03.6103077Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

2021-05-27T16:36:03.6107878Z 
2021-05-27T16:36:03.6112461Z Or undo this operation with:
