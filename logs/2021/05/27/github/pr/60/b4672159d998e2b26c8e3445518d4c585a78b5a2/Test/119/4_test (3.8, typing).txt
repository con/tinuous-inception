2021-05-27T16:36:04.0992971Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-27T16:36:04.0993806Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-27T16:36:04.0994766Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-05-27T16:36:04.0995238Z

2021-05-27T16:36:04.0996742Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-05-27T16:36:04.0998312Z 
2021-05-27T16:36:04.0998732Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-27T16:36:04.0999060Z
