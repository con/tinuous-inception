2021-05-27T16:36:04.4244231Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-27T16:36:04.4245334Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-27T16:36:04.4246431Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

2021-05-27T16:36:04.4256846Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-05-27T16:36:04.4258902Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-05-27T16:36:04.4259491Z 
2021-05-27T16:36:04.4260328Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-05-27T16:36:04.4260739Z 
2021-05-27T16:36:04.4261249Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-27T16:36:04.4261621Z 
2021-05-27T16:36:04.4262215Z   git switch -
2021-05-27T16:36:04.4262544Z
