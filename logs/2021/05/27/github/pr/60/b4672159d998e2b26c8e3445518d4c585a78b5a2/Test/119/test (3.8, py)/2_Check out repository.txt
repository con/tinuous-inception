2021-05-27T16:36:02.8204668Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-27T16:36:02.8205650Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-27T16:36:02.8206643Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

2021-05-27T16:36:02.8207919Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-05-27T16:36:02.8209123Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2021-05-27T16:36:02.8209672Z 
2021-05-27T16:36:02.8210819Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-05-27T16:36:02.8211318Z 
2021-05-27T16:36:02.8211872Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-27T16:36:02.8212306Z 
2021-05-27T16:36:02.8213057Z   git switch -
