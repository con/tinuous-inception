2021-05-27T16:27:53.7353101Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-27T16:27:53.7354040Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-27T16:27:53.7355104Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-05-27T16:27:53.7355633Z

2021-05-27T16:27:53.7357327Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-05-27T16:27:53.7358475Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-05-27T16:27:53.7358895Z 
2021-05-27T16:27:53.7359396Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-27T16:27:53.7359776Z
