2021-05-27T16:27:54.5900852Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-27T16:27:54.5901773Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-27T16:27:54.5902557Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-05-27T16:27:54.5903086Z 
2021-05-27T16:27:54.5903704Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-05-27T16:27:54.5904804Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-05-27T16:27:54.5906163Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-05-27T16:27:54.5906656Z 
2021-05-27T16:27:54.5907166Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-27T16:27:54.5907602Z
