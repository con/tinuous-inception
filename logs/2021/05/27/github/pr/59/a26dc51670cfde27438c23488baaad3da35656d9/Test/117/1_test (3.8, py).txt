2021-05-27T16:27:54.0859285Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-27T16:27:54.0860243Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-27T16:27:54.0861011Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2021-05-27T16:27:54.0861504Z 
2021-05-27T16:27:54.0862065Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2021-05-27T16:27:54.0863012Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-05-27T16:27:54.0864169Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-05-27T16:27:54.0864612Z 
2021-05-27T16:27:54.0865090Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-27T16:27:54.0865464Z
