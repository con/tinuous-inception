2021-05-27T16:27:55.0775081Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2021-05-27T16:27:55.0776024Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2021-05-27T16:27:55.0776869Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

2021-05-27T16:27:55.0779019Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

2021-05-27T16:27:55.0780224Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2021-05-27T16:27:55.0780583Z 
2021-05-27T16:27:55.0781139Z Or undo this operation with:
2021-05-27T16:27:55.0781519Z
